# Backtracking

# What is Backtracking?
Backtracking is an algorithmic-technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time.

# Steps to solve a problem using Backtracking:

# 1. Choice: 
    What are the possibles choices available.

# 2. Constrain: 
    Check whether the choice is feasible i.e, follows the given constrain.

# 3. Goal: 
    Get the optimal solution.
